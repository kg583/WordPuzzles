# World Cities
Let's find world cities inside English words.

"!" indicates the added constraint that the string cannot begin or end the word.

## Trivial
Cologne  Fez  Hamburg  Nice  Rome

## Easy
Paris  Rome!

## Medium
Basel  Bern  Paris!  Riga

## Hard
Athens  Lagos  Oslo  Tunis

## Bonus
Omaha (would never call Omaha a world city but damn itâ€™s a good word)

Sparta! (similar reasoning, as its ancient prominence does not carry over to today)
