# KG's Word Puzzles
I like words.

I made some puzzles about the weirder ones in the world.

Here they are.

More to come (probably).

## Rules
Most puzzles involving finding a given substring within a word, either because that substring is some other thing or it's just an unusual sequence.

The strings will be organized by difficulty and potentially marked with additional constraints.

* "!" indicates the added constraint that the string cannot begin or end the word.
* "<>" indicates the added constraint that the string must cross syllables.
