# Letter Perfect
In this puzzle, your task is to restore each of the strings below to a complete English word. To restore a string, you may insert two of the same letter anywhere within the string, including on the ends. No other edits to the string may be made.

The puzzle has a unique solution[^1] such that each letter is used once and only once to restore a string. Below is a sample puzzle using A, B, and C.

```
ath, bale, mnt

become

CatCh, baBBle, mAntA
```

In your solution, I would personally find it interesting if you could provide some description of your thought process and/or deductions or missteps.

Good luck!
