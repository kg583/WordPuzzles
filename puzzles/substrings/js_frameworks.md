Let's find JS frameworks inside English words. Each solution must properly contain the framework.

"!" indicates the added constraint that the string cannot begin or end the word.

"<>" indicates the added constraint that the string must cross syllables.

## Easy

## Medium
Node!   React!

## Hard
Meteor!   Polymer!   Sencha!
