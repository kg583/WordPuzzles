# Onomatopoeias

Let's find onomatopoeias inside English words. Onomatopoeias are words which refer to a sound by being a (close) transcription of that sound in English.

Each solution must contain at least one morpheme distinct from the given onomatopoeia. Basically, no "mooing" for "moo" or any lame shit like that.

"!" indicates the added constraint that the string cannot begin or end the word.

"<>" indicates the added constraint that the string must cross syllables.
